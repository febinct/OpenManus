# Automatic Agent Switching Based on Conversation Context: Test Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of testing automatic agent switching based on conversation context. The tests evaluate how well the system can detect appropriate agent roles from the content of user messages without explicit role requests.

The current implementation uses a keyword-based approach to detect the most appropriate agent role based on message content. Our testing shows an **overall accuracy of 57.6%** (19 correct detections out of 33 tests) across all test scenarios. While this is a reasonable baseline, there is significant room for improvement in the context-based role detection mechanism.

## Test Methodology

We tested the context-based role detection using the following approach:

1. Extracted all context-based switching turns from our test scenarios (33 turns total)
2. Ran each turn through the `detect_role_from_context` function
3. Compared the detected role with the expected role
4. Calculated accuracy metrics overall, by scenario, and by role
5. Analyzed failure cases to identify patterns and improvement opportunities

## Failure Analysis

We identified 14 failure cases out of 33 tests. Analysis of these failures revealed several common patterns:

1. **Missing keywords:** Many messages did not contain any of the predefined keywords for the expected role. For example:
   - "Now that I have the laptop, I'm having trouble setting it up. The screen keeps flickering when I turn it on." (Expected: Technical Support)
   - "I've been feeling tired lately and want to improve my energy levels. Can you suggest some lifestyle changes?" (Expected: Health Coach)

2. **Ambiguous context:** Some messages could reasonably belong to multiple roles, making it difficult to determine the correct role without additional context.

3. **Default role handling:** The system has no clear mechanism for handling general messages that don't require a specialized role.

4. **Contextual understanding:** The current keyword-based approach lacks understanding of the broader context and intent of the message.

## Key Findings

1. **Role-specific performance varies significantly:** Some roles like Data Analyst and Educational Tutor perform well, while others like Financial Advisor and Technical Support perform poorly.

2. **Keyword coverage is insufficient:** Many messages don't contain any of the predefined keywords for their expected roles.

3. **Simple scenarios perform better:** Scenarios with clear domain-specific language perform better than ambiguous or general scenarios.

4. **Default role detection is missing:** The system has no mechanism for detecting when no specialized role is needed.

5. **Context awareness is limited:** The current implementation doesn't consider conversation history or broader context.

## Improvement Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following improvements to enhance context-based role detection:

1. **Expand keyword lists:** Add more domain-specific keywords for each role, especially for roles with lower detection accuracy. For example:
   - Technical Support: Add "trouble", "screen", "flickering", "setting up"
   - Health Coach: Add "tired", "energy", "feeling", "lifestyle"
   - Financial Advisor: Add "budget", "set aside", "trip cost"

2. **Implement semantic matching:** Move beyond exact keyword matching to semantic similarity using word embeddings or language models.

3. **Add context awareness:** Consider previous messages and detected roles when making decisions about the current message.

4. **Implement fallback detection:** Create a mechanism to handle messages that don't match any specialized role.

5. **Use weighted scoring:** Assign different weights to keywords based on their specificity and relevance to each role.

6. **Add entity recognition:** Identify domain-specific entities (e.g., technical devices, financial terms, health conditions) to improve role detection.

7. **Consider message intent:** Analyze the intent of the message (e.g., asking for information, requesting help, giving feedback) as an additional signal.

## Conclusion

The current implementation of automatic agent switching based on conversation context achieves a moderate accuracy of 57.6%. While this provides a functional baseline, there is significant room for improvement, particularly for certain roles and scenarios.

The simple keyword-based approach works reasonably well for messages with clear domain-specific language but struggles with ambiguous messages or those lacking specific keywords. Implementing the recommended improvements would likely increase the accuracy and robustness of the context-based role detection mechanism.

Moving beyond simple keyword matching to more sophisticated natural language understanding techniques would be the most impactful improvement for enhancing the system's ability to automatically switch between agent roles based on conversation context.
