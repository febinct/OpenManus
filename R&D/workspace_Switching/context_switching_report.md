## Conclusion

The context-based agent switching mechanism needs significant improvement to reliably detect appropriate roles from context.

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Expand the keyword lists for roles with lower detection accuracy
2. Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques beyond simple keyword matching
3. Consider the conversation history for better context awareness
4. Add domain-specific entity recognition for better role matching
